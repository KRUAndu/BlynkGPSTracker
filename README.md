What you'll need on the hardware side:

* ESP32 (any should work, testing on Adafruit Huzzah32)
* Any TinyGSM library supported modem *WITH GPS*

I cannot recommend the ESP8266 due to limited serial. AT commands may not 

What you'll need on the software side:

* Blynk 
* TinyGSM (building on 0.7.9)
* TimeLib
* ESP32 board library
